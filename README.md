## Overview

This repository is a **research and defensive reference** that documents common concepts and patterns related to in‑game assist systems such as **aimbot**, **ESP**, and **wallhack** as they relate to *Rust*. The intent is to support anti‑cheat research, detection-signature development, and academic analysis of rendering, input‑manipulation, and memory‑interaction patterns. The project intentionally avoids operational deployment instructions and does not include kernel drivers, exploit code, or practical bypass techniques.

## Configuration example (documentation only)

A non-executable `config.ini` example illustrating typical parameters used in prototyping dashboards and test harnesses.

```ini
; Documentation-only configuration (non-executable)
[Telemetry]
EnableLogging = true
SampleRateHz = 60
LogDirectory = ./logs

[Visualization]
ShowPlayerMarkers = true
ShowLootMarkers = true
MaxRenderDistance = 800

[Analysis]
EnableAnomalyDetection = true
AnomalyThreshold = 0.85
ModelPath = ./models/detector.onnx
```

## Development & build notes (research)

* Language & tools: Documentation and prototypes use C++/C# for rendering prototypes, and Python for analysis and ML training.
* Build systems: CMake and Visual Studio solutions provided as examples for building sanitized prototypes (no exploit code included).
* Target environment: Windows 10/11 lab machines, sandboxed and segmented from production services.
* Data handling: All telemetry should be collected, stored, and processed in accordance with privacy laws and organizational policies.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome **only** when they improve defensive capabilities, test harnesses, or academic analysis. Examples of acceptable contributions:

* Detection signatures, telemetry schemas, and annotated datasets (sanitized).
* Test harnesses that simulate benign and anomalous input/rendering patterns in a non-operational way.
* Academic write-ups on detection techniques and responsible testing methodologies.

Please avoid submitting code or instructions that enable live cheating or anti‑cheat bypasses.

## Responsible disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability related to this project or third‑party systems, contact the affected vendor (e.g., the game publisher) through their official security channels. You may also open a private, security‑labelled issue in this repository to coordinate disclosure with the maintainers.

## SEO & discoverability notes

To improve discoverability for defensive researchers and anti‑cheat engineers, this README uses a set of targeted phrases such as: **Rust aimbot**, **Rust ESP**, **Rust wallhack**, **Rust Triggerbot**, and **cheat research**. For public forks focused on research, consider adding `docs/` pages (for example: `docs/detection-guides.md`, `docs/test-environments.md`) and a GitHub Pages site to index defensive materials and detection playbooks.
